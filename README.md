# Welcome to the barcode repo!

## Aim of this repo
* Generate barcodes
* Read barcodes
* Have a whole lot of fun with image processing

This project was implemented in Matlab and was done as part of a university course.
I was awarded a project mark of 100%.


## How to use this repo?
Glad you asked because its very simple. </br>
Simply run the GenerateBarcode.m Matlab file to generate a barcode. </br>
To read a barcode from an image file, run ReadBarcode.m and </br>
vallah you are now able to decipher the hidden meaning behind all those black and white lines. </br>
All the other .m files have functions that the scripts (GenerateBarcode.m and ReadBarcode.m) use. </br>
